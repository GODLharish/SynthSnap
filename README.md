*Real-time processing on mid-range mobile hardware*

## Key Features

| Feature | Technology | Benefit |
|---------|------------|---------|
| ðŸš€ Instant Preview | Zero-copy GPU pipeline | 40ms end-to-end latency |
| ðŸŒ™ Low-Light Boost | Adaptive tone mapping | +9.3dB PSNR improvement |
| ðŸ”‹ Power Optimized | Texture pooling & DVFS | 320mW sustained consumption |
| ðŸ“± Mobile-Optimized | GLES3 & NEON SIMD | 60fps @ 1080p |

## Technical Highlights

```cpp
// Example: Real-time processing pipeline
engine.processFrame(inputTexture, [](OutputFrame result) {
    // 12ms latency measured on Snapdragon 865
    display.render(result);
});
